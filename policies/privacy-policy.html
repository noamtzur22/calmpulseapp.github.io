        <p>
          We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to enable essential functionality, enhance security, and measure performance. We do not use cookies for behavioral advertising. Declining certain cookies or storage may impair the proper functioning of the App.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section-27-1">27.1 Types of Cookies/Storage</h3>

          <li><strong>Strictly Necessary</strong> – required for core features (authentication, session management, fraud prevention). Cannot be disabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics/Performance</strong> – aggregated usage metrics (e.g., crashes, session length) to improve stability and UX.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising</strong> – AdMob is configured for non‑personalized ads; device identifiers may still be used to limit fraud/abuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="section-27-2">27.2 Consent (EEA/UK)</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3 id="section-27-3">27.3 Managing Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Device settings: limit ad tracking/Reset Ad ID (iOS/Android).</li>

        <h2 id="section-13">Section 13 – Analytics &amp; Performance Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          We use Firebase Analytics and similar tools to collect aggregated, non-personal usage data (e.g., session duration, interactions, device/OS). This helps identify issues, improve UX, and understand usage patterns. Analytics data is anonymized and cannot identify individual users.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ad selection is based on general criteria, such as app category and region, not user profiling.</li>
